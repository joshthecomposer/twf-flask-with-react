                    <p>Founded and co-hosted by Andie, Tolkien with Friends was created to capture the conversations only best friends can have: silly, thoughtful, and serious all at once ‚Äî and always about the things those friends are passionate about.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In our case, that's the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, the Lord of the Rings movies, and fantasy in general. What started as a shared journey with two best friends comparing and contrasting the Lord of the Rings books and movies has since expanded to include a more friends and, really, a whole community of Tolkien fans.</p>

                    <p>What started as a series on her TikTok quickly became a passion project because Andie simply has too much to say about Lord of the Rings. Instead of simply revealing ‚ÄúLines from Lord of the Rings‚Äù she wished had been in the movies, she started a podcast with the goal of comparing the books and the movies chapter by chapter and scene by scene, turning her yearly re-read into a year-long project - and now a project with no end date üòú
