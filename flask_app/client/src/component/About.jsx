Instead of simply revealing ‚ÄúLines from Lord of the Rings‚Äù she wished had been in the movies, she started a podcast with the goal of comparing the books and the movies chapter by chapter and scene by scene, turning her yearly re-read into a year-long project - and now a project with no end date üòú
