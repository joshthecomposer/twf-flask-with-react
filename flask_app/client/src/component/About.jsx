                    <p className="tracking-normal font-medium text-[1.8rem] text-[#2d2d2d]">In our case, that's the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, the Lord of the Rings movies, and fantasy in general. What started as a shared journey with two best friends comparing and contrasting the Lord of the Rings books and movies has since expanded to include a more friends and, really, a whole community of Tolkien fans.</p>

Instead of simply revealing ‚ÄúLines from Lord of the Rings‚Äù she wished had been in the movies, she started a podcast with the goal of comparing the books and the movies chapter by chapter and scene by scene, turning her yearly re-read into a year-long project - and now a project with no end date üòú
